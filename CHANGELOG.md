# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project is pre-1.0 and follows semantic versioning for its public crates.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Cargo workspace with the `yet-present`, `yet-core` and `yet-app` crates.
- `yet-present`: `SessionTime`, physical-pixel geometry, `Scene`/`DrawCommand`,
  presenter, overlay, media-sequence and audio traits, and `RecordingPresenter`.
- `yet-core`: a pure `step` engine with start/pause/resume/abort/tick effects,
  `TestClock`, and the calibration data types.
- `yet-core`: experiment model (`Experiment`/`Block`/`Trial`/`Stimulus`),
  `config.toml` loading, optional `Experiment.csv` metadata, `Stimuli.csv`
  loading, typed validation, path resolution and deterministic per-block trial
  planning.
- `yet-core`: absolute-deadline trial scheduling in `step` with `TrialStarted`
  effects, per-tick frame records, late-tick accounting, pause/resume deadline
  shifts and an incomplete record when a session is aborted mid-trial.
- `yet-core`: `CalibrationGrid` with the Python 3×3 proportions and colors,
  `StimulusPlacement` for scaled and centered stimuli, and instruction-text
  scenes, all as backend-neutral `DrawCommand`s.
- `yet-core`: `DataSink` writing the yet_zero columns
  `Exp,Part,Stim,time,x,y,x_pro,y_pro`, with a header at creation and flush per
  trial.
- `yet-app`: `yet-app run --headless <dir> [--participant <id>] [--output <csv>]`
  drives a complete experiment with a synthetic 10 ms clock and writes the
  result CSV. A library target makes the runner testable without a window.
- `yet-app`: `yet-app plan <experiment-dir>` prints the resolved plan; a demo
  experiment lives in `examples/demo`.
- GitHub Actions CI for Linux, macOS, Windows and MSRV 1.88.
- README, ROADMAP and CHANGELOG.
- Sprint 1 risk-spike harnesses under `spikes/` and reports under `docs/spikes/`.

### Changed

- `EngineState` can carry a `SessionPlan`; `step` now schedules trials by
  absolute deadline instead of accumulating `dt`. `TrialRecord` and
  `FrameRecord` carry block, trial index and stimulus identifiers.
- The plan-less `Start` path is retained for the protocol skeleton: it changes
  phase and presents an empty scene but no longer fabricates a trial record.
- Project license changed from MIT to GPL-3.0-only, following the requirements
  recorded in `UI_analysis.md`.
- `UI_analysis.md`: corrected for eframe 0.37's `App::ui` entry point, rodio
  0.23's `SamplesBuffer` API and the absence of a `hound` feature; documented the
  Linux ALSA build prerequisite.
- `CV_analysis.md`: corrected for Rec. 601 luma (not `image::to_luma8`'s Rec. 709)
  and the macOS `objc_exception` build step in `nokhwa`.
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`: recorded Sprint 1 findings, risks and the build-prerequisite
  decision; recorded Sprint 2 as implemented.
- Linux audio is now verified with `libasound2-dev`; `get_pos()` measured
  ~128 ms behind wall clock, so S8 must compensate output latency.

### Known Issues

- There is no camera adapter yet, so a headless run writes the CSV header but
  no gaze rows. The scheduler, presenter commands and sink are exercised; the
  data path is not.
- The overlay runtime matrix on Windows, macOS, GNOME and KDE/Sway is still
  pending; the X11 proxy is not sufficient evidence for R11.
- The audio clock offset is device-dependent and is not compensated yet; the
  50 ms A/V target is not met uncompensated.
- macOS camera runtime and Xcode CLT behavior are not yet tested on hardware.
